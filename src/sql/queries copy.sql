-- PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING THE EXERCISE

-- ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This SQL file may crash due to two common issues: comments and missing semicolons.

-- ✅ Suggestions:
-- 1) Always end each SQL query with a semicolon `;`
-- 2) Ensure comments are well-formed:
--    - Use `--` for single-line comments only
--    - Avoid inline comments after queries
--    - Do not use `/* */` multi-line comments, as they may break execution
